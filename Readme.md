# The Practice of Statistics for Business and Economics Fifth Edition
The Practice of Statistics for Business and Economics Fifth Edition, Layth C. Alwan, Bruce A. Craig, George P. McCabe <br /> <br />
## How To Use:
Just download all files to a folder and open `Textbook.html` in your broswer. <br />
OR <br />
Download as `.zip` file and unzip all files into a folder and then open `Textbook.html` in your broswer. <br /> <br />
## Reason For This:
I can't stand the treacherous people sell pirated PDF textbooks for 20 dollors in WhatsApp. <br /> <br />

I also can't endure the high price of some "newest edition" textbook but only changing the order of practice questions so if student don't buy the newest edition then they cannot do their homework. <br /> <br />

Now there are so many excellent open source textbooks on the Internet, and many real talent people are also keep contributing to the open source knowledge. <br /> <br />

But those old antique professor are biased, they would like to earn knowledge monopoly money. <br /> <br />
