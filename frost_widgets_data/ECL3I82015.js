For each subject, a random digit is generated. If the digit is 0, 1 2, 3, or 4, the subject is assigned to the first treatment; if the digit is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, the subject is assigned to the second treatment.<\/li>&#13; <li id=\"snbte6dc091b8a69538762d608f21291\">An experiment will assign 60 rats to three different treatment conditions. The rats arrive from the supplier in batches of 20, and the treatment lasts two weeks. The first batch of 20 rats is randomly assigned to one of the three treatments, and data for these rats are collected. After a one-week break, another batch of 20 rats arrives and is assigned to one of the two remaining treatments. The process continues until the last batch of rats is given the treatment that has not been assigned to the three previous batches.<\/li>&#13; <li id=\"hxxm7a8357efac5bc42bbfe1008853ad\">A list of 40 subjects is entered into a computer file and then sorted by first name. The subjects are assigned to four treatments by taking the first 10 subjects for Treatment 1, the next 10 subjects for Treatment 2, and so forth.<\/li>&#13; <\/ol>"},"question_title":{"text":"3.57 What is wrong?
