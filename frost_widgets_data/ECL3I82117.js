In 2018, Incentive Research Foundation (IRF) conducted a survey of medium- (annual revenue between $100 million and $1 billion) and large-sized (annual revenue exceeding $1 billion) companies to study how much money is budgeted toward gift cards.<sup class=\"semantic-sup\" id=\"qubi8df290cc27578c81db528f5d8c8a\"><a epub:type=\"noteref\" role=\"doc-noteref\" class=\"noteref\" href=\"alw_9781319272463_EM_notes.xhtml#CH06-FN18\" id=\"CH06-RFN18\">18<\/a><\/sup> IRF sampled 300 companies, of which 48% were medium-sized and 52% were large-sized.

For those companies <i class=\"semantic-i\" id=\"zjdbd927a60bf07c83aed38fbcdcbec6\">having<\/i> a budget for gift cards, the average annual spending for gift cards was $450,000 and $1,010,000 for medium- and large-sized companies, respectively.<\/p>&#13; <ol class=\"ol-alpha-lc\" id=\"mrlzb967a2f15f27171ba10f7b7dce0a\"><li id=\"tpcc84402467b7eba7e616ae5205fe0e\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" id=\"page334\" aria-label=\"334\" title=\"334\"\/>Explain why these averages would be biased estimates of average spending by the general population of medium- and large-sized companies.
