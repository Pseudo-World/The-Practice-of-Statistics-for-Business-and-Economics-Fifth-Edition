Most economists disagree. In an experiment to examine the effects of using charts, business students trade (hypothetically) a foreign currency at computer screens. There are 20 student subjects available, named for convenience A, B, C, \u2026 , T. Their goal is to make as much money as possible, and the best performances are rewarded with small prizes. The student traders have the price history of the foreign currency in dollars in their computers. They may or may not also have software that highlights trends. Describe two designs for this experiment\u2014a completely randomized design and a matched pairs design in which each student serves as his or her own control. In both cases, carry out the randomization required by the design.<\/p>"},"question_title":{"text":"3.55 Does charting help investors?
