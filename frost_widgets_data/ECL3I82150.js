Also, use the multiple regression model where year and year2 are both explanatory variables to find another predicted value with the 95% interval. Explain why these two predicted values are so different. The actual yield for 2014 was 167.4 bushels per acre. How well did your models predict this value? <img class=\"size-large inline\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/psbe5e_13_pg_672_02.png\" alt=\"An icon reads CROPS.\" id=\"tecu9359d6ee4aef2970d30e39add196\"\/><\/p>"},"question_title":{"text":"13.109 Do a prediction.

For Year and Year2, the 95% prediction interval is (142.0, 185.0). The two predicted values are different because we are near the edge of the data for Year, and as we saw in the previous exercise, this will cause the greatest differences using the quadratic term.<\/p>"},"media":{"type":"no-media"},"question_stem_status":"2","question_generic_stem":"","question_prefix":"","question_separator":"","question_number":"","question_seperator":""},"VersionNo":"0","DisplayQuestionId":"ECL3I82150","OriginalQuestionId":"ECL3I82150","IsDeleted":false,"SelectedOptions":null,"question_number":"","question_prefix":"","question_seperator":""}]}
