This topic is traditionally taught using supplementary material printed on paper. The instructor for the course believes that a web-based interactive drawing program will be more effective in increasing the drawing skills of the students.<sup class=\"semantic-sup\" id=\"iasp71756d55d28b248877f0f23d8fea\"><a epub:type=\"noteref\" role=\"doc-noteref\" class=\"noteref\" href=\"alw_9781319272463_EM_notes.xhtml#CH03-FN23\" id=\"CH03-RFN23\">23<\/a><\/sup> The 50 students who are enrolled in the course will be randomly assigned to either the paper-based instruction or the web-based instruction.

The experimental units are students. The treatments are type of instruction, paper-based and web-based. The response variable is the change in standardized drawing test (pre versus post). The factor is the instructional method, with levels paper-based and web-based. The results would likely not be widely generalizable because the students were all in the same course but could probably be generalized to the same or similar courses in computer graphics technology.<\/p>"},"media":{"type":"no-media"},"question_stem_status":"2","question_generic_stem":"","question_prefix":"","question_separator":"","question_number":"","question_seperator":""},"VersionNo":"0","DisplayQuestionId":"ECL3I82152","OriginalQuestionId":"ECL3I82152","IsDeleted":false,"SelectedOptions":null,"question_number":"","question_prefix":"","question_seperator":""}]}
