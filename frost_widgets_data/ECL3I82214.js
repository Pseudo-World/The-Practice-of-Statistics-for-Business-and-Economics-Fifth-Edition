In a recent nationwide study by EDUCAUSE Center for Analysis and Research, it was found that 77% of students believe that hybrid learning is the most effective learning environment for them.<sup class=\"semantic-sup\" id=\"xvqf8609e9727567753f52c5b3f13fc3\"><a epub:type=\"noteref\" role=\"doc-noteref\" class=\"noteref\" href=\"alw_9781319272463_EM_notes.xhtml#CH05-FN20\" id=\"CH05-RFN20\">20<\/a><\/sup> You decide to poll a sample of the incoming students at your institution to gauge their attitude toward hybrid courses.
