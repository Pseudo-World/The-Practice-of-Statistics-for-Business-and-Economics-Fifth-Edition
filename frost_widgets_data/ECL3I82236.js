It doesn\u2019t mean they have to change by the same amount or a slope of 1. So as long as Fund A moves 20% and Fund B moves 10% consistently, up or down, you will still remain on the same regression line, and they will remain perfectly correlated.<\/p>"},"media":{"type":"no-media"},"question_stem_status":"2","question_generic_stem":"","question_prefix":"","question_separator":"","question_number":"","question_seperator":""},"VersionNo":"0","DisplayQuestionId":"ECL3I82236","OriginalQuestionId":"ECL3I82236","IsDeleted":false,"SelectedOptions":null,"question_number":"","question_prefix":"","question_seperator":""}]}
