Based on these reasons, do you think the reported averages of annual firm and worker premium contributions are biased?

Answers will vary for reasons of nonresponses; nonresponses are always to be considered a source of bias. It is likely the 40% of those who responded are different from those who didn\u2019t respond, so our estimated margin of error is not a good measure of accuracy.<\/p>"},"media":{"type":"no-media"},"question_stem_status":"2","question_generic_stem":"","question_prefix":"","question_separator":"","question_number":"","question_seperator":""},"VersionNo":"0","DisplayQuestionId":"ECL3I82240","OriginalQuestionId":"ECL3I82240","IsDeleted":false,"SelectedOptions":null,"question_number":"","question_prefix":"","question_seperator":""}]}
