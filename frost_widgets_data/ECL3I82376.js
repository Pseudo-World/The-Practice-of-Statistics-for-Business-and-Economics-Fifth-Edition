Part of the campaign was based on a study conducted to determine the effect of additional milk in the diet of adolescents over a period of 18 months. A control group received no extra milk. Growth rates of total body bone mineral content (TBBMC) over the study period were calculated for each subject. Data for the group who received the extra milk and the control group were then used to examine the relationship between growth rate of TBBMC and age.<\/p>&#13;\n<ol class=\"ol-alpha-lc\" id=\"ajmnf97a806670bac3d7a0b3e851527c\"><li id=\"gzaoad83688b4e8ca111b413ed8408b4\">How would you classify the data used to evaluate the effect of the additional milk in the diet?
