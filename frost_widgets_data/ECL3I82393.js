For age 15 to 19: 89.7% are full-time and 10.3% are part-time. For age 20 to 24: 81.82% are full-time and 18.18% are part-time. For age 25 to 34: 50.06% are full-time and 49.94% are part-time. For age 35 and over: 27.15% are full-time and 72.85% are part-time.<\/p>&#13; <p epub:type=\"answer\" class=\"answer noindent\" id=\"vsiq94c78f5143a3efed20583301c656\">d. Students aged 15\u201324 are much more likely to be full-time, while students aged 35 and over are more likely to be part-time. Students aged 25\u201334 are about equally likely to be full- or part-time students.<\/p>&#13; <p epub:type=\"answer\" class=\"answer noindent\" id=\"fmjl735aed72ca2a1e1727bd695b9bec\">e. Because there are only 2 categories for status, if we are given the percent of full-time students, the percent of part-time students must be 100% minus the percent for full-time.<\/p>&#13; <p epub:type=\"answer\" class=\"answer noindent\" id=\"oydj841c9cd251199d85d8000bde89ec\">f. Both are valid descriptions; it mostly depends on what condition the student(s) you are interested in is. If we are interested in a particular age group, the current analysis likely has more meaning, whereas if we are interested in a particular status, the previous analysis has more meaning.<\/p>"},"media":{"type":"no-media"},"question_stem_status":"2","question_generic_stem":"","question_prefix":"","question_separator":"","question_number":"","question_seperator":""},"VersionNo":"0","DisplayQuestionId":"ECL3I82393","OriginalQuestionId":"ECL3I82393","IsDeleted":false,"SelectedOptions":null,"question_number":"","question_prefix":"","question_seperator":""}]}
