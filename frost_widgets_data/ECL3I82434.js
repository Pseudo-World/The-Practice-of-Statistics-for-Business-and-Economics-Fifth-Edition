One way to create a column of differences is to subtract the lag price variable from the original price variable. <img class=\"dataset\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/psbe5e_04_PG181.png\" alt=\"An icon reads VISA.\" data-path=\"\" id=\"rrcl126287497c5abfbc8b1fd3af4767\"\/><\/p>&#13; <ol class=\"ol-alpha-lc\" id=\"msbq3cc313e0d0c66782270269d71e61\"><li id=\"wgiw33952227b0db17e6cccfb2b327af\">Using software, plot the price changes over time.
