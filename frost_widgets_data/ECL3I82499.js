According to the rule, 68% of women speak between 5232 and 23,362 words per day; 95% of women speak between \u22123833 and 32,427 words per day; and 99.7% of women speak between \u221212,898 and 41,492 words per day.<\/p>&#13; <p epub:type=\"answer\" class=\"noindent\" id=\"iguxafa2ce33a0a3cdd738eaf2957648\">b. This rule doesn\u2019t seem to fit because you can\u2019t speak a negative number of words per day; therefore, the percents don\u2019t make sense.<\/p>&#13; <p epub:type=\"answer\" class=\"noindent\" id=\"xsci85c938376f7f9cc16c494d5cb687\">c. According to the rule, 68% of men speak between 5004 and 23,116 words per day; 95% of men speak between \u22124052 and 32,172 words per day; and 99.7% of men speak between \u221213,108 and 41,228 words per day. Similar to the women, the rule doesn\u2019t seem to fit because, again, you can\u2019t speak a negative number of words per day, so the percents don\u2019t make sense.<\/p>&#13; <p epub:type=\"answer\" class=\"noindent\" id=\"fkuhbdaf9f17a929ad13e49504c0d69d\">d. The data do show that the mean number of words spoken per day is higher for women than for men, but it is very close; in addition, the standard deviations are nearly the same, making the intervals very close. To put it in perspective, the women only speak about 1%\u20132% more words per day on average. That small of a difference could be due just to chance.<\/p>"},"media":{"type":"no-media"},"question_stem_status":"2","question_generic_stem":"","question_prefix":"","question_separator":"","question_number":"","question_seperator":""},"VersionNo":"0","DisplayQuestionId":"ECL3I82499","OriginalQuestionId":"ECL3I82499","IsDeleted":false,"SelectedOptions":null,"question_number":"","question_prefix":"","question_seperator":""}]}
