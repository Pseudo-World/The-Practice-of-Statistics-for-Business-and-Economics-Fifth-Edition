The data for year 1997 would be the explanatory variable; the data for year 2017 would be the response. We would expect the 1997 data to explain, and possibly cause, changes in the 2017 data. The form is roughly linear; the direction is positive; the strength is moderate. Low- and middle-income countries are the outlier.<\/p>"},"media":{"type":"no-media"},"question_stem_status":"2","question_generic_stem":"","question_prefix":"","question_separator":"","question_number":"","question_seperator":""},"VersionNo":"0","DisplayQuestionId":"ECL3I82524","OriginalQuestionId":"ECL3I82524","IsDeleted":false,"SelectedOptions":null,"question_number":"","question_prefix":"","question_seperator":""}]}
