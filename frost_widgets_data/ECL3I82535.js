The <i class=\"semantic-i\" id=\"fdlja8fd302240851613496eb5a989a6\">Law of Large Numbers<\/i> applet allows you to roll several dice and watch the outcomes. (Ignore the title of the applet for now.) Because simulation\u2014just like real random phenomena\u2014often takes very many trials to estimate a probability accurately, let\u2019s simplify the question: is this probability clearly greater than 0.5, clearly less than 0.5, or quite close to 0.5? Use the applet to roll four dice until you can confidently answer this question. You will have to set \u201cRolls\u201d to 1 so that you have time to look at the four up-faces. Keep clicking \u201cRoll dice\u201d to roll again and again. How many times did you roll four dice? What percent of your rolls produced at least one 6?<\/p>"},"question_title":{"text":"4.11  A question about dice.
