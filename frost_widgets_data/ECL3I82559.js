Marketers want to know. An experiment prepared three sets of beverages. Set 1 contained two milk drinks and two fruit drinks. Set 2 had two fruit drinks and four milk drinks. Set 3 contained four fruit drinks but only two milk drinks. The researchers divided 120 children aged 4 to 12 years into three groups at random. They offered each group one of the sets. As each child chose a beverage to drink from the set presented, the researchers noted whether the choice was a milk drink or a fruit drink.<\/p>&#13; <ol class=\"ol-alpha-lc\" id=\"gtlmbef640cf82f371d67bc8cf27be8d\"><li id=\"yjrd0e6bff96bce0799ec9bbb613918d\">What are the experimental subjects?<\/li>&#13; <li id=\"jhgqfb284e971cbeda63ec57fc14f063\">What is the factor and what are its levels?
