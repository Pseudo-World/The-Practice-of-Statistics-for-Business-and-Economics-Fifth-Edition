Those regions with relatively large percents might be good prospects for marketing products for seniors. In addition, you might want to examine the change in this population over time and then focus your marketing on provinces and territories where this segment of the population is increasing. <img class=\"dataset\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/psbe5e_01_PG23b.png\" alt=\"An icon reads CANADA P.\" data-path=\"\" id=\"pdzhb19c061c2df7155e85ba3ba5317a\"\/><\/p>&#13; <ol class=\"ol-alpha-lc\" id=\"wiyg8217c16a58f66b39c65c77e469b6\"><li id=\"ilpy9f373062b1fca816c2bca7a29ada\">For 2011 and for 2017, describe the total population, the population older than age 65, and the percent of the population older than age 65 for each of the 13 Canadian provinces and territories.

Population values did not change that much from 2011 to 2017. Ontario and Quebec have the largest populations, followed by Alberta and British Columbia. For the population over age 65, most regions have similar percents of over 65 except the three territories that are most northern; similar to the overall population, these numbers didn\u2019t change much between 2011 and 2017. For percent of population over 65, four areas dominate: Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta. Again, the numbers did not change drastically between 2011 and 2017.<\/p>&#13; <p epub:type=\"answer\" class=\"noindent\" id=\"klpj6677f0e794d4986297db546f14a7\">b. Answers will vary. Most marketing techniques for targeting seniors should mention the four areas with the highest population over age 65: Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta.<\/p>"},"media":{"type":"no-media"},"question_stem_status":"2","question_generic_stem":"","question_prefix":"","question_separator":"","question_number":"","question_seperator":""},"VersionNo":"0","DisplayQuestionId":"ECL3I82588","OriginalQuestionId":"ECL3I82588","IsDeleted":false,"SelectedOptions":null,"question_number":"","question_prefix":"","question_seperator":""}]}
