In the hotel industry, there is a high human component, so these sorts of failures commonly occur regardless of extensive training and established policies. As a result, hotel firms must learn to effectively react to these failures. One study investigated the relationship between a consumer\u2019s transaction history (levels: long and short) and an employee\u2019s statement of thanks (levels: yes and no) on a consumer\u2019s repurchase intent.<sup class=\"semantic-sup\" id=\"nplv90b1ead54d7d762c86f709d75f10\"><a epub:type=\"noteref\" role=\"doc-noteref\" class=\"noteref\" href=\"alw_9781319272463_EM_notes.xhtml#CH16-FN13\" id=\"CH16-RFN13\">13<\/a><\/sup> Each subject was randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups and asked to read some service failure\/resolution scenarios and respond accordingly.
