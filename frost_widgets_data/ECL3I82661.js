Let\u2019s describe this increase. Productivity is defined as output per unit input. \u201cTotal factor productivity\u201d (TFP) takes all inputs (labor, capital, fuels, and so on) into account. The data set AGPROD contains TFP for the years 1948\u20132015.<sup class=\"semantic-sup\" id=\"irxmdbb7599c6442c24e1b7594c6e7b7\"><a epub:type=\"noteref\" role=\"doc-noteref\" class=\"noteref\" href=\"alw_9781319272463_EM_notes.xhtml#CH12-FN023\" id=\"CH12-RFN023\">23<\/a><\/sup> The TFP entries are index numbers; that is, they give each year\u2019s TFP as a percent of the value for 1948. <img class=\"size-large inline\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/Data_analytics_AGPROD.png\" alt=\"An icon reads A G P R O D.\" id=\"znok310db838a4da3925d8382206e733\"\/><\/p>&#13; <ol class=\"ol-alpha-lc\" id=\"mujjfcae7d9250a892c99025256df9ac\"><li id=\"csjs9ae0c63774b3699fdd09cd737527\">Plot TFP against year.

Overall, there has been rapid growth in agricultural productivity since 1948. But there was a significant shift in that productivity around 1980. Before that, the growth, on average, was between 155% and 179% each year; after 1980, the growth was between 293% and 353% each year. These results are at 95% confidence.<\/p>"},"media":{"type":"no-media"},"question_stem_status":"2","question_generic_stem":"","question_prefix":"","question_separator":"","question_number":"","question_seperator":""},"VersionNo":"0","DisplayQuestionId":"ECL3I82661","OriginalQuestionId":"ECL3I82661","IsDeleted":false,"SelectedOptions":null,"question_number":"","question_prefix":"","question_seperator":""}]}
