Putting the ads into a news program was extremely good because it doesn\u2019t place the focus on the ads themselves, which could eliminate some biases. Because each subject was exposed to all the ad repetition levels, this is not a standard two-factor ANOVA. More advanced statistical methods are needed for inference. The facts about the ads being judged to be \u201cgood\u201d and edited by professionals is good and makes our results more likely to apply in other professional settings, especially since they were also pretested and thought to be real. Overall, the experiment was set up quite well, though it might be good to test the ads in other regions.<\/p>"},"media":{"type":"no-media"},"question_stem_status":"2","question_generic_stem":"","question_prefix":"","question_separator":"","question_number":"","question_seperator":""},"VersionNo":"0","DisplayQuestionId":"ECL3I82679","OriginalQuestionId":"ECL3I82679","IsDeleted":false,"SelectedOptions":null,"question_number":"","question_prefix":"","question_seperator":""}]}
