As is often done, the survey is conducted by telephone. As it turns out, the business was only able to elicit responses from less than 10% of the randomly chosen customers.

Undaunted, the marketing manager was pleased with the sample results because the margin of error was quite small, and thus the manager felt that the business had a good sense of the customers\u2019 perceptions on various issues. Do you think the small margin of error is a good measure of the accuracy of the survey\u2019s results? Explain.<\/p>"},"question_title":{"text":"7.21 Survey response and margin of error.
