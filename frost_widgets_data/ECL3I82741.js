So if we get an out-of-control point above the UCL, we want to find the source of the special cause and try to correct it. However, if we get an out-of-control point below the LCL, we want to find the source of the special cause and mimic it in the future to potentially change (reduce) the level of the process.<\/p>"},"media":{"type":"no-media"},"question_stem_status":"2","question_generic_stem":"","question_prefix":"","question_separator":"","question_number":"","question_seperator":""},"VersionNo":"0","DisplayQuestionId":"ECL3I82741","OriginalQuestionId":"ECL3I82741","IsDeleted":false,"SelectedOptions":null,"question_number":"","question_prefix":"","question_seperator":""}]}
