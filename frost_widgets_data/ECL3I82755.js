The U.S. Postal Service is one such provider of services. We wonder if the number of days a letter takes to reach another city is affected by the time of day it is mailed and whether the zip code is used. Describe briefly the design of a two-factor experiment to investigate this question. Be sure to specify the treatments exactly and to tell how <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" id=\"page172\" title=\"172\" aria-label=\"172\"\/>you will handle lurking variables such as the day of the week on which the letter is mailed.<\/p>"},"question_title":{"text":"3.113 Quality of service.

The factors are time of day and zip code (used or not). The treatments would be all the different combinations of time of day and zip code. Lurking variables and solutions will also vary.
