Include the least-squares regression line on the plot. There is an unusual pattern for the vehicles with high city MPG. Describe it.<\/li>&#13; <li id=\"joxy1cfe2895715f74a00d24fe30bfb0\">Make a plot of the residuals versus city MPG. Describe the major features of this plot. How does the unusual pattern noted in part (a) appear in this plot?<\/li>&#13; <li id=\"riqb87c5d1722193170bdc5984dfed44\">The Lexus 450h AWD that you examined in parts (b) and (c) of the previous exercise is in the group of unusual cases mentioned in parts (a) and (b) of this exercise. This hybrid vehicle uses a conventional engine and a electric motor that is powered by a battery that can recharge itself when the vehicle is driven. The conventional engine also turns off when the vehicle is stopped in traffic. As a result of these features, hybrid vehicles are unusually efficient during city driving, but they do not have a similar advantage when driven at higher speeds on the highway. How do these facts explain the residual for this vehicle?<\/li>&#13; <li id=\"sourf4ac0ac95ca91e9e71f6d5089bed\">Several Toyota vehicles are also hybrids. Use the residuals to suggest which vehicles are in this category.<\/li>&#13; <\/ol>"},"question_title":{"text":"2.63 Fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions.

The vehicles with high city MPG don\u2019t follow the regression line; rather, they have a much lower highway MPG than the regression line would predict.<\/p>&#13; <p epub:type=\"answer\" class=\"answer noindent\" id=\"qtbu26f8933dc0a92d2851219028ec33\">b. For the vehicles with high city MPG, all of the residuals are negative, creating a curve in the plot, suggesting a possible transformation is necessary.<\/p>&#13; <p epub:type=\"answer\" class=\"answer noindent\" id=\"qmsp270a2c1ee900b186c401262e4668\">c.
