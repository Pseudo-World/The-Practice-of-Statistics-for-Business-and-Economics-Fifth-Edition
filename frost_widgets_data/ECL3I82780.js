In that example, we used MPG as the explanatory variable and CO<sub class=\"sematic-sub\" id=\"noqxd1775a79662390193b18c2c545fb\">2<\/sub> as the response variable. Fuel efficiency expressed as MPG in our data set is a composite of 55% city fuel efficiency and 45% highway fuel efficiency. The data set also includes variables that give fuel efficiency in terms of fuel consumption expressed as liters per 100 kilometers for both city and highway driving. Using <a class=\"crossref\" href=\"alw_9781319272463_ch02_02.xhtml#ch02_ex_7\" id=\"ch02_refundi_75\">Example 2.7<\/a> as a guide, analyze the relationship between city fuel efficiency and highway fuel efficiency and write a short summary of your results. <img class=\"dataset\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/psbe5e_02_PG74b.png\" alt=\"An icon reads CAN FUEL.\" data-path=\"\" id=\"apmx3dad437e0039c0eb802dc2d605c2\"\/><\/p>&#13; "},"question_title":{"text":"2.21 Fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions.

The relationship, however, is not linear but curved. There also seem to be two distinct lines or groups.
