We won’t discuss the telemarketer who begins a telephone sales pitch with “I’m conducting a survey.” Such deception is clearly unethical. It enrages legitimate survey organizations, which find the public less willing to talk with them. Neither will we discuss those few researchers who, in the pursuit of professional advancement, publish fake data. There is no ethical question here—faking data to advance your career is just wrong. But just how honest must researchers be about real, unfaked data? Here is an example that suggests the answer is “More honest than they often are.”

Ethical difficulties are easier to identify in experiments that impose a treatment on people. However, sample surveys can also result in harm, particularly when they concern sensitive issues. Here are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by any study that gathers data from human subjects, whether it is a sample survey or an experiment.

Instead, the board’s purpose is, in the words of one university’s board, “to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) recruited to participate in research activities.” The board reviews the plan of the study and can require changes in it. It reviews the consent form to ensure that subjects are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once research begins, the board monitors the study’s progress at least once a year.
    </p>
        <p class="indent" id="osxq54b1b3099cd5d772c57a09199463">The most pressing issue concerning IRBs is whether their workload has become so large that their effectiveness in protecting subjects drops. When the government temporarily stopped human-subject research at Duke University Medical Center in 1999 due to inadequate protection of subjects, more than 2000 studies were going on. That’s a lot of review work. There are shorter review procedures for projects that involve only minimal risks to subjects, such as most sample surveys. When a board is overloaded, however, there is a temptation to put more proposals in the minimal-risk category to speed the work.

Some researchers, especially in medical trials, regard consent as a barrier to getting patients to participate in research. To “get around” this barrier, they may not explain all possible risks; they may not point out that other therapies might be better than those being studied; and they may be too optimistic in talking with patients even when the consent form has all the right details. Of course, mentioning every possible risk leads to very long consent forms that really are barriers. “They are like rental car contracts,” one lawyer said. Some subjects don’t read forms that run five or six printed pages. Others are frightened by the large number of possible (but unlikely) disasters that might happen and so refuse to participate. Of course, unlikely disasters sometimes happen. When they do, lawsuits follow—and the consent forms become yet longer and more detailed.

Anonymity is rare in statistical studies. Even where it is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail), anonymity prevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform subjects of results.
    </p>
        <p class="indent" id="vuss169e25e03cfa945e3289eba4583f">Any breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best practice is to separate the identity of the subjects from the rest of the data at once. Sample surveys, for example, use the identification only to check on who did or did not respond. In an era of advanced technology, however, it is no longer enough to be sure that each set of data protects people’s privacy. The government, for example, maintains a vast amount of information about citizens in many separate databases—census responses, tax returns, Social Security information, data from surveys such as the Current Population Survey, and so on. Many of these databases can be searched by computers for statistical studies. A clever computer search of several databases might be able, by combining information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you even if your name and other identification have been removed from the data available for search. A colleague from Germany once remarked that “female full professor of statistics with PhD from the United States” was enough to identify her among all the 83 million residents of Germany. Privacy and confidentiality of data are hot issues among statisticians in the digital age.

Some people believe that people should be able to forbid any other use of their data, even when all identification of those data is removed. This would prevent the use of government records to study, say, the ages, incomes, and household sizes of Social Security recipients. Such a study could well be vital to debates on reforming Social Security. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large right inline" id="scau6dbec944519694643a318ba3fcfd" role="presentation" src="../images/psbe5e_12_pg09.png" /></p>

          <li id="utpkfd58a7e5b5973b77fb00a4ef910c">Clinical trials produce great benefits, but most of these benefits go to future patients. The trials also pose risks, and these risks are borne by the subjects of the trial. So we must balance future benefits against present risks.</li>
          <li id="nbwp09f3e443b1f877db5c61e98ff6cf">Both medical ethics and international human rights standards say that “the interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.”</li>

Beginning in 1943, penicillin became available to treat syphilis. The study subjects were not treated.

Yet AIDS is more common in parts of Africa than anywhere else. Several clinical trials being conducted in Africa are looking at ways to prevent pregnant mothers infected with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) from passing the infection to their unborn children, a major source of HIV infections in Africa. Some people say these trials are unethical because they do not give effective AIDS drugs to their subjects, as would be required in rich nations. Others reply that the trials are looking for treatments that can work in the real world in Africa and that they promise benefits at least to the children of their subjects. What do you think?

          <li id="qsijd306513cdae3e756fcadc12d0e06">There is no risk of harm to the subjects, although they would certainly object to being watched through a periscope. Even when physical harm is unlikely, do other types of harm need to be considered? Emotional harm? Undignified situations? Invasion of privacy?</li>
          <li id="atnb6d53d3b2110e897f141c23fde657">What about informed consent? The subjects did not even know they were participating in an experiment. Many behavioral experiments rely on hiding the true purpose of the study. The subjects would change their behavior if told in advance what the investigators were studying. Subjects are asked to consent on the basis of vague information. They receive full information only after the experiment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indent" id="vulq2fd358408c5917f343cf45141dd5">The “Ethical Principles” of the American Psychological Association require consent unless a study merely observes behavior in a public place. They allow deception only when it is necessary to the study, does not hide information that might influence a subject’s willingness to participate, and is explained to subjects as soon as possible. The personal space study (from the 1970s) does not meet current ethical standards.
    </p>
        <p class="indent" id="xbhd87bad95a8e75cca746e04123767e">As this discussion suggests, the basic requirement for informed consent is understood differently in medicine and psychology. Here is an example of another setting with yet another interpretation of what is ethical. The subjects get no information and give no consent. They don’t even know that an experiment may be sending them to jail for the night.

            <p class="noindent" id="wjxy784ef0f25566919c9d10e1abd633">How should police respond to domestic-violence calls? In the past, the usual practice was to remove the offender and order the offender to stay out of the household overnight. Police were reluctant to make arrests because the victims rarely pressed charges. Women’s groups argued that arresting offenders would help prevent future violence even if no charges were filed. Is there evidence that arrest will reduce future offenses? That’s a question that experiments have tried to answer.
        </p>
            <p class="indent" id="jdeh1a724802e7939b4798a60b9602f1">A typical domestic-violence experiment compares two treatments: arrest the suspect and hold the suspect overnight or warn and release the suspect. When police officers reach the scene of a domestic-violence call, they calm the <span aria-label="168" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page168" role="doc-pagebreak" title="168"></span>participants and investigate. Weapons or death threats require an arrest. If the facts permit an arrest but do not require it, an officer radios headquarters for instructions. The person on duty opens the next envelope in a file prepared in advance by a statistician. The envelopes contain the treatments in random order. The police either make an arrest or warn and release, depending on the contents of the envelope. The researchers then watch police records and visit the victim to see if the domestic violence recurs.
        </p>
            <p class="indent" id="evat1ecbb28527fc11b241468ee754eb">Such experiments show that arresting domestic-violence suspects does reduce their future violent behavior.<sup class="semantic-sup" id="pyiu5441c8cda3e708936ff8ca329a55"><a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="alw_9781319272463_EM_notes.xhtml#CH03-FN34" id="CH03-RFN34" role="doc-noteref" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></sup> As a result of this evidence, arrest has become the common police response to domestic violence. <img alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="decorative size-large right inline" id="zqgoc0e9f74f56b2ecec00a7e345301d" role="presentation" src="../images/psbe5e_12_pg09.png" /></p>

        <p class="indent" id="jqbs804f47676340a09178f06edce067">The domestic-violence experiments shed light on an important issue of public policy. Because there is no informed consent, the ethical rules that govern clinical trials and most social science studies would forbid these experiments. They were cleared by review boards because, in the words of one domestic-violence researcher, “These people became subjects by committing acts that allow the police to arrest them. You don’t need consent to arrest someone.”

The combination consists of a relatively inexpensive and widely used drug, Zocor, and a newer drug called Zetia. Early study results suggested that Vytorin was no more effective than Zetia. Critics claimed that the makers of the drugs tried to change the response variable for the study, and two congressional panels investigated why there was a two-year delay in the release of the results. Use the Web to search for more information about this controversy, and write a report of what you find. Include an evaluation in the framework of ethical use of experiments and data.

Because AIDS is so common in parts of Africa, that is the easiest place to test a vaccine. It is likely, however, that a vaccine would be so expensive that it could not (at least at first) be widely used in Africa. Is it ethical to test in Africa if the benefits go mainly to rich countries? The treatment group of subjects would get the vaccine, and the placebo group would later be given the vaccine if it proved effective. So the actual subjects would benefit and the future benefits then would go elsewhere. What do you think?
